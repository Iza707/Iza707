- 👋 Hi, I’m @Iza707
- 👀 I’m interested in learning code languages, games, and music
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and, after some perfection, C
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything as of the moment, however If there is anything
      that can help further my understanding of coding and data management, all the better.
- 📫 I don't have any social medias to be reached out on except for discord, but that's for another day :)
